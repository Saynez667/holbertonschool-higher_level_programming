# Python Import & Modules

## Description
This project aims to explore the concepts of importing and modules in Python. It covers the use of modules, function imports, handling command-line arguments, and applying Python style standards.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Understand the importance of modules in Python.
- Import functions and variables from other files.
- Use built-in and custom modules.
- Understand and use the `dir()` function.
- Prevent a script from executing when imported.
- Handle command-line arguments.

## Requirements
- Editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- Execution on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.10.*)
- Compliance with `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable

## Project Content

### 0. Import a Simple Function
Write `0-add.py`, which imports the function `add(a, b)` from `add_0.py` and prints the result `1 + 2 = 3`.

### 1. My First Toolbox
Create `1-calculation.py`, which imports functions from `calculator_1.py` and performs basic mathematical operations.

### 2. Make a Script Dynamic
Create `2-args.py` that prints the number and list of command-line arguments.

### 3. Infinite Addition
Create `3-infinite_add.py` to sum all command-line arguments.

### 4. Who Are You?
Create `4-hidden_discovery.py` that prints the names defined in a compiled module, excluding those starting with `__`.

### 5. Everything Can Be Imported
Create `5-variable_load.py`, which imports and prints the variable `a` from `variable_load_5.py`.

## Usage
Each script can be executed from the command line as follows:
```bash
./script_name.py arg1 arg2 ...
Make sure to make your scripts executable with:
```
