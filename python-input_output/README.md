# Python I/O Project - Reading, Writing, and JSON Serialization 🌐📚

This project focuses on the basics of file handling, text processing, and serialization in Python. Through a series of tasks, you will learn how to read and write files, work with JSON data, and manipulate Python objects for storage and retrieval.

## Learning Objectives 🧠

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the power and ease of Python programming
- Open and read text files, write to them, and manage file contents
- Use the `with` statement to handle file operations safely
- Work with the JSON format for serialization and deserialization
- Convert Python objects into JSON strings and vice versa
- Use Python's command-line arguments to interact with scripts

## Key Concepts

- Opening Files: Learn how to open and read/write files
- Text File Operations: Read entire files, read line by line, and write content
- JSON: Learn how to serialize and deserialize data to/from JSON
- Command-Line Parameters: Access and use parameters passed to Python scripts via the command line

## Requirements ⚙️

### Python Scripts

- Allowed Editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files should be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.8.5
- File Format: All Python files must end with a new line
- The first line of each Python file should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- PEP 8 Compliance: Your code should follow the Python style guide (pycodestyle version 2.7.*)
- Executable Files: All Python scripts must be executable

### Test Files

- Location: All test files should reside in a folder called `tests`
- Format: Test files must have the `.txt` extension
- Execution: Tests can be executed using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- Each module, class, and function should have documentation explaining their purpose and usage
