# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object 🐍✨

This project explores the fundamental concepts of objects, references, mutability, and identity in Python. It is designed to deepen your understanding of how Python handles variables, assignments, and object manipulation—essential for writing robust and efficient code. 🚀

## Learning Objectives 🎯

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Define what an object is in Python 🧱
- Distinguish between a class, an object, and an instance 🏷️
- Explain the difference between mutable and immutable objects 🔄🔒
- Understand references, assignments, and aliasing 🔗
- Determine if two variables reference the same object or different objects 🧐
- Retrieve the identifier (memory address) of a variable 🆔
- List Python’s built-in mutable and immutable types 📚
- Describe how Python passes variables to functions and the implications for mutable and immutable objects 🧩

## Project Structure 🗂️

The project consists of a series of questions and exercises about Python’s object model. You are expected to answer conceptual questions, analyze code snippets, and implement small scripts. All answers must be provided in single-line `.txt` files, and scripts must comply with `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*).

### Key Topics Covered

- **Objects and Values:** Everything in Python is an object, including numbers, strings, and functions 🏗️
- **Aliasing and References:** How variable assignment works and how multiple variables can reference the same object 🔄
- **Mutability:** The distinction between mutable (e.g., lists, dictionaries) and immutable (e.g., integers, strings, tuples) types 📝
- **Cloning and Copying:** How to create copies of objects to avoid unintended side effects 🧬
- **Identity and Equality:** The difference between `is` (identity) and `==` (equality) operators 🆚

## Requirements ✅

- All scripts must be executable and start with `#!/usr/bin/python3` 🐍
- Only the following editors are allowed: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs` 📝
- All files will be run on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python 3.8.5 🐧
- All answer files must be one line, no extra spaces, and no shebang ✂️
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project is mandatory 📄

## Example Tasks 💡

- Identify the function to print the type of an object 🏷️
- Determine if two variables point to the same object 🔍
- Explain the output of code involving mutable and immutable types 📊
- Write a function to copy a list without importing any modules 📝
- Distinguish between tuples and non-tuples in various assignments 🥇

## Resources 📚

Before starting, review the following topics:

- [Objects and values](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#objects-values-and-types) 📖
- [Aliasing](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#aliasing) 🔗
- Immutable vs mutable types 🔄
- Mutation in Python 🧬
- [Cloning lists](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#cloning-lists) 📋
- Python tuples: immutable but potentially changing 🧊

## Best Practices 🌟

- **Read and think before coding:** Try to answer conceptual questions by reasoning, not just by running code 🤔
- **Use clear, concise answers:** All answer files should be one line with no extra spaces 🧹
- **Understand the “why”:** Focus on understanding the reasoning behind Python’s behavior with objects and variables 🧠
