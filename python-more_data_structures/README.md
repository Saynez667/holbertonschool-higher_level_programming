# python-more_data_structures

This project explores more data structures in Python, including sets, dictionaries, and the use of lambda, map, reduce, and filter functions.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without assistance:

### General

*   Why Python programming is awesome
*   What are sets and how to use them
*   What are the most common methods of set and how to use them
*   When to use sets versus lists
*   How to iterate into a set
*   What are dictionaries and how to use them
*   When to use dictionaries versus lists or sets
*   What is a key in a dictionary
*   How to iterate over a dictionary
