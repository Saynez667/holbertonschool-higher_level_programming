# Python - If/Else, Loops, and Functions

## Description

This project covers fundamental concepts of Python control flow, loops, and functions. It includes exercises to practice conditional statements (`if`, `if...else`), loops (`for`, `while`), functions, and Python best practices.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Understand the importance of indentation in Python.
- Use `if` and `if...else` statements correctly.
- Write and recognize comments in Python code.
- Assign and modify values of variables.
- Use `while` and `for` loops.
- Utilize `break` and `continue` statements within loops.
- Understand the `else` clause in loops.
- Learn the purpose of the `pass` statement.
- Use the `range()` function.
- Define and use functions in Python.
- Understand the return behavior of functions without a `return` statement.
- Identify variable scope (global vs. local).
- Read and interpret Python tracebacks.
- Use arithmetic operators correctly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8.*
- Code must comply with `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*)
- All files must be executable.
- The first line of all scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- Scripts must be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

| `7-islower.py` | Checks if a character is lowercase. |
| `8-uppercase.py` | Converts a string to uppercase without using `str.upper()`. |
| `9-print_last_digit.py` | Prints the last digit of a number. |
| `10-add.py` | Adds two integers and returns the result. |
| `11-pow.py` | Computes the power of a number. |
| `12-fizzbuzz.py` | Implements the FizzBuzz game for numbers 1 to 100. |

## Usage
