# Python - Introduction to Python Scripting

## Author’s Disclaimer

Welcome to the Python world!

You'll soon find that with Python (and most higher-level languages), there are multiple ways to accomplish the same task. Some exercises will require a specific implementation, while others will allow for multiple solutions.

Python follows a style guide called PEP8, also known as PyCode. At Holberton, we do not enforce PyCode initially, as it is stricter than PEP8. If you see warnings while running PEP8, you can ignore them.

Enjoy coding!

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

### General
- Use the Python interpreter.
- Print text and variables using `print()`.
- Work with strings in Python.
- Understand string indexing and slicing.
- Follow the official Python coding style (PEP8) and check your code with `pycodestyle`.

---

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All scripts will be executed on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using **Python 3.8**.
- All files must end with a **new line**.
- The first line of all files must be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the repository **is mandatory**.
- Your code must conform to `pycodestyle` (version `2.7.*`).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be checked using `wc`.

---

## Pycodestyle

`pycodestyle` is now the official standard for Python code styling. Ensure your code follows its guidelines.

## Tasks

### **0. Hello, print**
- Write a Python script that prints exactly:
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle"

markdown
Copier
Modifier
using the `print()` function.

### **1. Print integer**
- Modify the given source code to print an integer stored in `number`, followed by `"Battery street"`.

### **2. Print float**
- Modify the source code to print a float stored in `number` with **two decimal places**.

### **3. Print string**
- Print a string **three times** and then print its **first 9 characters**.

### **4. Play with strings**
- Concatenate two strings to output `"Welcome to Holberton School!"`.

### **5. Copy - Cut - Paste**
- Extract and manipulate parts of a string without using loops or conditionals.

### **6. Create a new sentence**
- Rearrange a given string to form `"object-oriented programming with Python"`.

### **7. Easter Egg**
- Write a script that prints `"The Zen of Python"` by Tim Peters.
